# Development Guidelines

This document outlines the development practices, code organization, and contribution guidelines for the Wellness Buddy application.

## Code Organization

The codebase follows a feature-based organization within the MVC pattern:

### Controllers

- Located in `src/controllers/`
- One controller file per feature area
- Follow naming convention: `FeatureController.js`
- Export singleton instances
- Include JSDoc comments for all methods

### Models

- Located in `src/models/`
- One model file per entity
- Implement business logic and data validation
- Include static factory methods (e.g., `fromApiResponse`)
- Use class syntax for clarity

### Views

- Located in `src/views/`
- Organized by feature in subdirectories
- Components follow naming convention: `FeatureNameView.jsx`
- Reusable components in `src/views/components/`
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility

### Services

- Located in `src/services/`
- Handle API communication
- Abstract external dependencies
- Follow naming convention: `FeatureService.js`
- Export singleton instances

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Use ES6+ features and syntax
- Maintain consistent code formatting with ESLint
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Keep functions and methods small and focused

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Extract complex logic to custom hooks or controllers
- Maintain clear separation between UI and business logic
- Use proper prop validation with TypeScript or PropTypes
- Implement error boundaries for fault tolerance

### State Management

- Use React's built-in state management where possible
- Leverage controllers for complex state logic
- Keep state as close as possible to where it's needed
- Use callbacks for component communication
- Document state management decisions

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Avoid custom CSS where possible
- Maintain consistent spacing and sizing
- Follow the design system color palette
- Ensure responsive design for all components

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - For new features
- `bugfix/bug-description` - For bug fixes
- `hotfix/issue-description` - For critical fixes

### Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issue numbers where applicable
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Follow conventional commits format when possible

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a PR against the `develop` branch
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Request reviews from team members
4. Address review comments
5. Squash commits if necessary
6. Merge only after approval

## Weekly Development Process

### Planning

1. Define weekly goals and tasks
2. Assign responsibilities
3. Estimate effort and complexity
4. Document decisions and rationale

### Development

1. Follow the git workflow
2. Maintain communication about progress
3. Address blockers proactively
4. Document architectural decisions

### Documentation

1. Update blog with progress and challenges
2. Document code with comments and JSDoc
3. Update LinkedIn with key achievements
4. Keep the README current

### Review

1. Conduct weekly code reviews
2. Test features thoroughly
3. Document lessons learned
4. Plan for the next week

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Test individual components and functions
- Focus on business logic and edge cases
- Use Jest for testing framework
- Aim for high coverage of critical code

### Integration Testing

- Test interactions between components
- Validate controller-service interactions
- Test API integration points
- Ensure proper error handling

### UI Testing

- Test component rendering and behavior
- Validate user interactions
- Test responsive design
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Deployment

### Development Environment

- Deploy from the `develop` branch
- Use Netlify or Vercel for frontend hosting
- Update environment variables as needed
- Document deployment steps

### Production Environment

- Deploy from the `main` branch
- Use continuous deployment when possible
- Include version tags for releases
- Maintain deployment history

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for functions and methods
- Document complex algorithms and workflows
- Include examples for non-obvious code
- Keep documentation close to the code

### Project Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date README
- Document architecture and design decisions
- Include setup and deployment instructions
- Provide troubleshooting guides

### User Documentation

- Create clear user guides
- Document features and functionality
- Include screenshots and examples
- Keep documentation accessible
